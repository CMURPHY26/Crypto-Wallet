## Personal Crypto Tracker Desktop App

This is a super quick tool I built to simply keep track of my crypto holdings. I have the counts in a personal file as a backup so that I don't rely exclusively on localStorage.

It links to Coinbase because Kraken is restricted in NY.

It's too cumbersome to keep track of holdings across:

- Robinhood: for short-term profit booking on BTC and ETH from free investments
- Coinbase: for altcoins that cost a fortune to transfer
- Daedalus: ADA
- Cold Wallets
  - ETH
  - BTC
