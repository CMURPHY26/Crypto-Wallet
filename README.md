## Personal Crypto Tracker Desktop App

This is a super simple tool I built quickly to keep track of my crypto holdings.

NOTE: Must use browser extension to bypass CORS

It links to Coinbase because Kraken is restricted in NY.

It's too cumbersome to keep track of holdings across:

- Robinhood: for short-term profit booking on BTC and ETH from fee-free recurring investments
- Coinbase: for altcoins that cost a fortune to transfer to/from a wallet
- Daedalus: ADA
- Cold Wallets
  - ETH
  - BTC
